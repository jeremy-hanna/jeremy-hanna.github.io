- new hire
- on-boarding is not about the new employee, but your team's expectations on
  what they can do to help her succeed
- with that in mind, have a checklist. Keep it flexible. Keep it structured but
  not rigid. We're all humans and most importantly for a new employee is for
  them to feel welcomed to the team.
- Process
- Organization
- To whom do I ask questions?
- Domain gotchas
- What is expected of my time?
